# SHA1 Chosen-prefix Collision Attack

This repository contains additional data and code from two papers:

> [*From Collisions to Chosen-Prefix Collisions ‚Äî Application to Full SHA-1*](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/459)  
> Ga√´tan Leurent and Thomas Peyrin  
> Eurocrypt 2019

> [*SHA-1 is a Shambles: First Chosen-Prefix Collision on SHA-1 and Application to the PGP Web of Trust*](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/014.pdf)  
> Ga√´tan Leurent and Thomas Peyrin

## Repository content

This repository includes:

1. A full description of the **set of output differences** ùìì and the
   bundles used in the attack.  This was obtained by sampling the last
   rounds of SHA-1, and extends the partial data given in
   Table¬†4 of the Eurocrypt paper.  
   The set is described in file `diff_group.h`, and the program
   `sampling.c` can be used to verify the sampling.

2. A **simulator** for the attack, to enable easy verification of our
   claims (see below for details).  This corresponds to the Eurocrypt attack.

3. A **graph** for the attack, corresponding to the set ùì¢
   with maximum cost 2√óC_block_ (first line of Table¬†5).  
   This corresponds to a variant of the Eurocrypt attack.  
   Due to size limits, the graph is not in the git repo, but if available as part of the releases:  
   https://github.com/Cryptosaurus/sha1-cp/releases/download/v1/diffset  
   (Note: the graph only contains the nodes, the edges are recomputed on the fly)

4. The **GPU code** to generate near-collision blocks, improved from the
   code of the Shattered attack.  
   This is the code from the Usenix attack.
   
In order to make sure proper countermeasures can be deployed before
harmful exploitation of SHA-1 chosen-prefix collisions, we are not
releasing the full source code of the attack at this point.
   
## Attack simulator

### What the simulator does

For each block, our simulator computes the message equations and list
of useful output differences from the graph ùìñ
and simulates the attack by picking random messages and internal
states at step 64 until reaching a useful output difference.  This
validates both the overall attack strategy, and the sampling results;
the simulation results closely match the claims in the paper.

### How to use it

To compile the program, just run `make`.  To use the simulator, you
need a graph for the attack; you can download one with a release of
the code: https://github.com/Cryptosaurus/sha1-cp/releases/download/v1/diffset

There are several ways to use the attack simulator, here are a few example:

1. Generate conditions and path template for a given difference
```
./simulator -sdiffset -dffffda04/fffffed4/fffffffc/fffffff8/00000000 -ttemplate
```

2. Simulate attack form a random input difference in the set
```
./simulator -sdiffset -b
```
