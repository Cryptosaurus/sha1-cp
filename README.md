# SHA1 Chosen-prefix Collision Attack

This repository contains additional data for the paper:

> *From Collisions to Chosen-Prefix Collisions ‚Äî Application to Full SHA-1*  
> Ga√´tan Leurent and Thomas Peyrin  
> Eurocrypt 2019

The paper has been published at Eurocrypt 2019, and a preprint is
available at https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/459.


## Repository content

This repository includes:

1. A full description of the **set of output differences** ùìì and the
   bundles used in the attack.  This was obtained by sampling the last
   rounds of SHA-1, and extends the partial data given in
   Table¬†4 of the paper.  
   The set is described in file `diff_group.h`, and the program
   `sampling.c` can be used to verify the sampling.

2. A **simulator** for the attack, to enable easy verification of our
   claims (see below for details).

3. A **graph** for the attack, corresponding to the set ùì¢
   with maximum cost 2√óC_block_ (first line of Table¬†5).  
   Due to size limits, the graph is not in the git repo, but if available as part of the releases:  
   https://github.com/Cryptosaurus/sha1-cp/releases/download/v1/diffset  
   (Note: the graph only contains the nodes, the edges are recomputed on the fly)

## Attack simulator

### What the simulator does

For each block, our simulator computes the message equations and list
of useful output differences from the graph ùìñ
and simulates the attack by picking random messages and internal
states at step 64 until reaching a useful output difference.  This
validates both the overall attack strategy, and the sampling results;
the simulation results closely match the claims in the paper.

### How to use it

To compile the program, just run `make`.  To use the simulator, you
need a graph for the attack; you can download one with a release of
the code: https://github.com/Cryptosaurus/sha1-cp/releases/download/v1/diffset

There are several ways to use the attack simulator, here are a few example:

1. Generate conditions and path template for a given difference
```
./simulator -sdiffset -dffffda04/fffffed4/fffffffc/fffffff8/00000000 -ttemplate
```

2. Simulate attack form a random input difference in the set
```
./simulator -sdiffset -b
```
